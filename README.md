# Convex-Hull
1. A numbered list A convex hull is a convex polygon that encloses all the points in it
1. A numbered list Quick Hull Algorithm is used to find the convex hull of points in 2-D space in this project
1. A numbered list The Basic idea is to improve runtime of the algorithm using K-means clustering technique
1. A numbered list The points are divided into clusters and their respective convex hulls are found and combined
1. A numbered list One more time the algorithm is applied to obtain the final Convex Hull
1. A numbered list The parallelization is done in 3 ways using the following:
* Bullet list OpenMP
* Bullet list MPI
* Bullet list Hybrid ( OpenMP + MPI )
