# Convex-Hull
**Strong text** A convex hull is a convex polygon that encloses all the points in it.
**Strong text** Quick Hull Algorithm is used to find the convex hull of points in 2-D space in this project
**Strong text** The Basic idea is to improve runtime of the algorithm using K-means clustering technique
**Strong text** The points are divided into clusters and their respective convex hulls are found and combined
**Strong text** One more time the algorithm is applied to obtain the final Convex Hull
**Strong text** The parallelization is done in 3 ways using the following:
* Bullet list OpenMP
* Bullet list MPI
* Bullet list Hybrid ( OpenMP + MPI )
